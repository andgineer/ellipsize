# Ellipsize with style

Pretty reducing huge Python objects to visualise them nicely.

Handy for AWS outputs etc.

# Documentation

# MkDocs

Also, this serves as axample of multi-language [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) project.
I honestly tried to make it as in https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions/2346
but failed.

So this is just two separate MkDocs projects in one repo, for two languages.
And you can debug them locally with `make serve-ru` and `make serve`.

Another failed attempt was to use [include snipped](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/).
For unknown reason it did not render the code blocks.

# Developers
